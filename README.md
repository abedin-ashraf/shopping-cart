# Shopping Cart

This is a simple HTML file that represents a shopping cart interface. It allows users to add and remove items from their cart, and it calculates and displays the subtotal, tax, and total price of the items in the cart.

## Features

- Display of cart items: The HTML file includes the structure and styling for displaying cart items, including their images, names, quantities, and individual prices.
- Quantity manipulation: Users can increase or decrease the quantity of each item by clicking on the plus and minus buttons associated with each item. The total price for each item is updated accordingly.
- Subtotal, tax, and total calculation: The HTML file includes elements for displaying the subtotal, tax, and total price of all items in the cart. The values are calculated based on the quantities and prices of the individual items.
- Check out: There is a "Check Out" button at the bottom of the cart that can be used to proceed with the purchase.

## Prerequisites

This code relies on the following dependencies, which are included via external links in the HTML file:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/): A popular CSS framework used for styling the web page.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/): A library of icons used for displaying plus, minus, and remove icons.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. The shopping cart interface will be displayed, showing the items, quantities, and prices.
3. To increase or decrease the quantity of an item, click on the plus or minus button associated with that item. The total price for the item will be updated accordingly.
4. The subtotal, tax, and total prices will be automatically calculated and displayed based on the quantities and prices of the items.
5. Click on the "Check Out" button to proceed with the purchase.

## Customization

To customize the shopping cart:

- Modify the HTML structure to add or remove items from the cart. Each item is represented by a `<div>` element with the class "cart-item". You can copy and paste the existing `<div>` structure for each item and modify the content (image source, item name) as needed.
- Adjust the prices of the items by modifying the JavaScript code. The current prices are hardcoded in the `updateItemNumber` function.
- Customize the styling of the shopping cart by modifying the CSS code in the `<style>` tags. You can change colors, spacing, fonts, and other visual aspects to match your desired design.

Note: Make sure to update the paths to external dependencies (Bootstrap, Font Awesome) if you decide to host them locally instead of using the provided external links.

## Limitations

This code is a simplified representation of a shopping cart and does not include any server-side functionality, payment processing, or user authentication. It is meant to demonstrate the basic functionality of a shopping cart interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Please note that this code does not handle any server-side or database operations, so any changes made to the cart (adding/removing items, changing quantities) will be lost upon page refresh. It is intended for demonstration purposes only.
